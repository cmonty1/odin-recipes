        Steak is an easy protein to cook. One of the best parts of cooking steak is that there a multiple ways to do it
        and different ways to try it. On top of that it tastes great.
    </p>
    <p>
        Steak can be served with many different sides. Usually a vegetable is included. My favorite sides are potatos and asparagus.
        Steak can also be used in other meals like tacos or sandwiches.
