    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The cheeseburger is a favorite of mine. It has rich flavors and great texture.
        It is a staple in the United States and can be found in almost any restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cheeseburger is best served with a side of fries or chips, but can be served with almost anything.
        Salads and onion rings are also popular options for sides. It can be cooked in a pan/griddle or on a grill.
